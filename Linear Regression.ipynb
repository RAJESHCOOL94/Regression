Linear regression is based on least square estimation which says regression coefficients should be chosen in such a way that it minimizes the sum of the squared distances of each observed response to its fitted value. While logistic regression is based on Maximum Likelihood Estimation which says coefficients should be chosen in such a way that it maximizes the Probability of Y given X (likelihood).<br><br>\n",
    "5. Linear regression is used to estimate the dependent variable incase of a change in independent variables. For example, relationship between number of hours studied and your grades. Whereas logistic regression is used to calculate the probability of an event. For example, Predicting if a given user will buy an insurance product or not."
